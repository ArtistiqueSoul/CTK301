                <h2>A Note from Amber: Genre Options</h2>
                <p>The genres I included by name (Hip-Hop, R&B/Soul, and Lo-Fi) are my three favorite genres, and therefore the genres I worked the most on developing tracks for!</p>
                <p>I grew up listening to a lot of Hip-Hop and R&B/Soul, with hints of Jazz and Gospel in many of the songs I listened to. When coming up with my projects, I would keep elements like this in mind to give my music the same feel as I experienced while growing up.</p>
                <p>Lo-Fi music has played a surprisingly large role in my life in recent years. It all started because a friend of mine who had built a presence on YouTube used to play this type of music during breaks in their live-streams, and I found myself very relaxed when listening to it. I then fell into a bit of a rabbit-hole looking for Lo-Fi music that helped me relax. I have found many playlists of Lo-Fi music from other creators that are especially helpful when I sleep or study. As someone who struggles with anxiety, I have turned to Lo-Fi music to help manage stress in minor situations and it inspired me to come up with some laid-back tracks for others that have the same feel as Lo-Fi, though my version has more of a Hip-Hop element to it than traditional Lo-Fi music.</p>
