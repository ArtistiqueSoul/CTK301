                <h2>A Note from Amber: Years</h2>
                <p>I first began experimenting with creating instrumental tracks in 2021; at the time, I was still in high school and knew little-to-nothing about music production and what exactly it entails.</p>
                <p>Since I primarily grew up listening to Hip-Hop and R&B/Soul, my projects were centered around those two genres. I was fascinated at the use of bass in many of the songs I heard, so I attempted to replicate this sound in my own tracks (as you'll come to find out, sometimes it turned out well; other times, it didn't).</p>
                <p>I included tracks I made way back when I was just starting out solely for the purpose of showing others who are in my shoes (that is, wanting to become a music producer or be in a similar field) that everybody starts out not knowing much of anything and that there are bound to be mistakes. I also keep it here as a reminder to myself of how far I've really come from where I started. I tend to give myself less credit tha I really deserve.</p>
